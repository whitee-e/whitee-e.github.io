## Data Sources and Project Ideas
1. [Analyzing students' mental health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aminasalamat/mental-health-of-students-dataset) <br>
Using the Mental Health of Students dataset on Kaggle. This dataset contains self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as each student’s field of study, course year, and other demographics. I’d be interested in comparing gender and stress levels, or how GPA relates to mental health. (Do students with high GPAs have better or worse mental health?)

1. [Representing global health trends 2000-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malaiarasugraj/global-health-statistics/data)<br>
This global health statistics dataset on Kaggle has longitudinal global health data from 2000 to 2024. I would like to represent this longitudinal data on a plot showing year on the x axis and global health stats (e.g. mortality rate by country, disease prevalence, etc.) on the y axis. I would aim to emulate the style and professionalism of WHO reports.

1. [Measuring wellbeing from the 2023 National Wellbeing Survey](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/39192/datadocumentation)<br>
This National Wellbeing Survey (2023) from ICPSR measures many variables relating to wellbeing (mental, economic, and social) as well as demographic information. I would like to analyze which age groups or demographics have the highest rates of wellbeing and the lowest rates of depression. I am also interested in making scatterplots to see if some variables are correlated (for example, is more social activity correlated with lower depression scores?).
<br>
<br>
1. [Representing consumer health experiences and opinions](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/38596/variables)<br>
This survey (results on ICPSR) assesses aspects of health literacy as well as participants’ opinions on the healthcare system. I’d be interested in learning which issues were most pressing to survey respondents, and which solutions seemed the most attractive. I wonder how people’s knowledge of healthcare systems influenced their perspectives on the issues in US healthcare. How do health literacy, age, and ethnicity correlate with differing perceptions on healthcare?
<br>
<br>
1. [Using 'Our World in Data' to compare longitudinal global health data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=earliest..1951)<br>
I am intrigued by many datasets on the Our World in Data site, such as this one on life expectancy by country over time, starting in 1770. The site displays some powerful visualizations of the life expectancy dataset through maps and line graphs. I have some ideas of how I could use this data to emulate figures in WHO reports or other prominent NGOs. I am also interested in using multiple datasets from this site and merging the data to compare variables by country and time (for instance, how does life expectancy compare to GDP or population size?).<br>

## Above and Beyond - embedded Homework 2 live visualization
This visualization uses an [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/33242) dataset on HIV stigma in adults over 50 in the PNW from 2003-2005. I examined the correlation between reported stigma experienced and reported depression symptoms.
